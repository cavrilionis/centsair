Atmotube,AQS,41,60,Polluted,"Air quality is poor, and you may experience symptoms such as coμghing and throat irritation. The pollution may cause breathing discomfort on prolonged exposure, and discomfort to people with heart disease or asthma. Try not to stay in this environment for a long period of time.",2,Minute
Atmotube,AQS,21,40,Very polluted,"Air quality is very poor. It may cause respiratory illness in people on prolonged exposure. The effect may be more pronounced in people with asthma, lung and heart diseases. Adults and children with lung problems and adults with heart problems should reduce strenuous physical exertion, particularly if they experience symptoms. People with asthma may find that they need to use their rescue inhaler more often. Older people should also reduce physical exertion.",1,Minute
Atmotube,AQS,0,20,Severly polluted,"Air pollution is severe. At this level it may be necessary to take emergency measures for patients and members of sensitive groups, and this can have harmful consequences for most of the people. Health impacts may be experienced even during light physical activity. Healthy people may experience adverse symptoms.",0,Minute
